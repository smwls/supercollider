# supercollider and tidalcycles experiments

this is a "backup repo" containing my experiments with
[Supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), an extremely powerful
platform and object-oriented language for algorithmic composition and synth
design, and [Tidalcycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), a Haskell-based DSL for the construction of complex musical patterns.
Highly recommended if you're at all interested in coaxing strange beguiling noises from your computer.
